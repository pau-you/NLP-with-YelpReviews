# Using NLP to Discern Between Real and Fake Yelp Reviews

This project seeks to minimize damaging, fake reviews that especially affects small businesses. In this project, we implement n-grams and gpt-2 to create more fake reviews. We evaluated for fake reviews by using neural networks and drew comparisons with human accuracy by conducting a survey with all the same reviews.
